# QUESTION 1
# Write code using a while loop that asks the user to enter a number 
# and will run forever until the user enters a number greater than 10.
puts "You are stuck in this paradox until you enter a number greater than a predetermined value. Enter a number:"
while true
    num = gets.chomp.to_i
    if num > 10
        puts "You have exited this loop..."
        break
    end
    puts "Guess again. We can keep going until the end of time..."
end
# QUESTION 2
# The following code will run 100 times, and each time it will ask the user for their name. 
# The code will break early if the user's name is Bob.
# Rewrite the code using a while loop so the program will run *forever* unless 
# the user enters a name of Bob.
while true
  puts "What is your name?"  
  name = gets.chomp
  if name == "Bob"
    break
  end
end
puts "Hi, Bob!"
